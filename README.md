# Project Overview
The task is to generate a virtual image from an __arbitrary__ view angle based on stereo images.

## 1. Epipolar Rectification 

The images are rectified, such that the epipolar lines are parallel to each other, which constraints the search of corresponding points on a line instead of the whole image.

### 1.1 Harris Corner Detector
Detect the corner in images according to the change of image brightness with Harris detector.

## 2. Disparity Map Generation

Semi-global block matching (SGBM) [1] is used to obtain a dense stereo matching.
